# Advent of Code 2023

My solutions to Advent of Code 2023 [https://adventofcode.com/2023].

Test the implementations:

```bash
cargo test
```

To run individual days:

```bash
cargo run dayn input
```
where day_n_ is the day and the input is either a .txt file or a string input, depending on the day.
